# Dementia Prediction

Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a decline in cognitive function and memory loss. It is a significant public health issue, particularly among the elderly population, as it affects their daily activities, independence, and quality of life. Early detection and diagnosis of dementia are crucial for timely intervention and support for affected individuals. 

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project was collected from mobile health care services provided in collaboration with elderly care centers operated by local non-governmental organizations. These health care services were offered to elderly individuals residing in different districts of Hong Kong. The services were provided free of charge over a ten-year period, specifically from 2008 to 2018. The dataset likely contains information related to the health status, demographics, and other relevant factors of the community-dwelling elderly population in Hong Kong during that time frame.

Overall, these metrics imply that LR outperforms SVM in terms of accuracy, capturing agreement beyond chance (kappa), and specificity. On the other hand, SVM performs slightly better than LR in terms of sensitivity. However, it's important to consider the specific context of the problem and the relative importance of these metrics to determine which model is more suitable for the given task.
